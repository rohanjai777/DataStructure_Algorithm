/*You are given an integer array containing 1 to n but one of the number from 1 to n in the array is missing. You need to provide optimum solution to find the missing number. Number can not be repeated in the arry.
Solution:
Find the sum of n number using formula n=n*(n+1)/2
Find the sum of elements present in given array.
Substract (sum of n numbers â€“ sum of elements present in the array).*/
